        <p class="card-text">Nearing 1 year completion of my S-Presso vxi plus ags. not even a small lag till date. and super quiet engine until 100 km/h speed. Everything is appreciable in this small though in looks but very spacious for a family of 4
        
nothing much to complain about this mini boy. this has become our family member right from the time of purchase. excellent suspension especially in bumpy roads. super quiet engine, powerfull ac and excellent speaker system makes this car an ideal companion for city as well on highway. can go for this without second thought.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Buying experience is awesome and Dealer also helped us to find the correct model as perrequirement. The riding experience is just freaking fantastic and ride quality is awesome as well. Looks are very aggressive, in each and every model there is LED taillights which are cool and not like other cars in base model there are only halogen and in top there is LED. I had driven my car for 10000 kms and this service cost was only 5,000 Rsperfect maintenance costs and not much if your driving is not as rash Mileage in city is around 14-15 km/l and on highways</p>

        <p class="card-text">Buying Experience-is good with Hyundai their sales Executives are very cooperative and humble. Driving Experience- Santro is good for city drives, but it completely fails in long drives. Engine is not responsive. You have to down shift gears frequently for overtaking another cars. Look & Performance- Look is decent , but the front grill of Santro looks very outdated and make of low quality material some kind of plastic, Performance is good at city drive, but not good on highways. while taking reverse on ascending road, the engine sounds a lot and make vibration.</p>
